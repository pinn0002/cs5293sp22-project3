pinn0002	training	Nuff	████ Said.<br /><br />These Lines are Just Filler.
pinn0002	training	Deniz Akkaya	The only nice thing about the movie are ████████████'s breasts.	
pinn0002	training	Howard Hughes	Was this an early variation of beefcake courtesy of █████████████?
pinn0002	training	Boris Karloff	Look fast to spot a very young █████████████ as the ship purser.
pinn0002	training	Sophia Loren	I watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of ████████████.
pinn0002	training	Kinski	Being a Spaghetti Western enthusiast, I found it fun to watch, but if you're not, never mind this movie, or watch it only for the purpose of seeing ██████ play a priest.
pinn0002	training	Harry	The gags spaced out in a way that gives maximum effect too, and █████ gets his own version of a Lloyd or Keaton style stunt at the end.
pinn0002	training	Giù La Testa	I the particular case of "████████████... Hombre" of 1971 he just took the title of Sergio Leone's "████████████" (aka.
pinn0002	training	Fidani	Infamous Director Demofilo ██████, however, is rightly known for some of the cheapest, trashiest, and, well, worst contributions to the genre.
pinn0002	training	Schwarzenegger	In the book, ██████████████'s character is put on a game show.
pinn0002	training	Stephen King	I am probably one of the few who actually read ████████████'s book, the one this movie was based on.
pinn0002	training	Sean Penn	█████████ headed a jury not long ago.<br /><br />For my music-related rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
pinn0002	training	Che	Wearing ███'s by-now cliché image has become as common as having a Bart Simpson coffee cup.
pinn0002	training	Kubrick	Even a director as brilliant as ███████ would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour mark, so it's quite telling that this Soderbergh, who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career, would think that His Oceanic Grandness was up to the task.
pinn0002	training	Del Toro	Nevertheless, however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been, one thing nobody could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why ████████ fits the bill only visually.
pinn0002	training	Oliver Stone	Where was ████████████ all these years?
pinn0002	training	Ashley	"When in Rome" was a traditional Mary-Kate and ██████ movie, complete with the foreign travel, accents, motorbikes, adult romance as a "B" storyline, fashion orientation, and even the gag reel over the credits.
pinn0002	training	Tatyana Samojlova	<br /><br />█████████████████ is perfect as Veronika.	
pinn0002	training	Jason Segel	I hear that ███████████ is going to star in one soon.
pinn0002	training	Boris	It's the classic story of lovers (█████ & Veronika) separated by the war and of what comes between them.
pinn0002	training	Murphy	I know I admired ██████, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time.
pinn0002	training	Rocky	It was only the second film to illicit that response (█████ was the first) and there haven't been many since.
pinn0002	training	Muppet	The first ██████'s movie, The ██████ movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent.<br /><br />The ██████ movie is about how they all got started.
pinn0002	training	Nolan	<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this, I intend to get all of █████'s films.
pinn0002	training	David Julyan	I also thought that the score from ████████████ was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it.
pinn0002	training	Schrader	I have seen many ideas of what various people think the theme of the film is, what ████████ is trying to say.
pinn0002	training	Mishima	███████ has already said it, the film simply repeats.
pinn0002	training	Joan Crawford	Haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on West Point and █████████████, the local beauty.
pinn0002	training	William	███████ Bakewell also scores as the skinny follower.
pinn0002	training	Haines	And amazingly touching after ██████'s character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets.
pinn0002	training	Nelson Algren	).<br /><br />Preminger's direction was, as usual, borderline flawless.<br /><br />Haven't read █████████████'s novel nor have any idea how faithful the screenplay was to it.
pinn0002	training	Elmer Bernstein	She was gorgeous!<br /><br />Loved the jazz score by ███████████████!
pinn0002	training	Kim Novak	Loved █████████!
pinn0002	training	Zosch	While there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes, █████'s death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly.
pinn0002	training	Frank	The film moves quickly and it shows █████'s drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture.
pinn0002	training	Preminger	█████████ may have been aiming for a dream effect, as the cardboard backgrounds give the proceedings the surreal feeling of a nightmare operetta, perhaps harking back to █████████'s early days in Vienna.
pinn0002	training	 Mr. Magoo	What, one wonders, was Preminger up to, and why did he do the movie this way?<br /><br />The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a █████████ cartoon.
pinn0002	training	Nelson	██████ Algren, on whose novel the movie is based, went on record as despising it.
pinn0002	training	Frankie	███████ tries to getaway from the life that he lead but has this monkey or, better yet, gorilla on his back that just won't let him.
pinn0002	training	Mr. Bean	When I was younger, and today, ████████ is a work of genius.
pinn0002	training	Rowan Atkinson	██████████████ was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 24 on The Comedians' Comedian, and he was number 8 on Britain's Favourite Comedian.
pinn0002	training	Fulci	This is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie █████ did.
pinn0002	training	Lucio Fulci	There is some really nasty gore scenes also, of course, because it's ███████████.
pinn0002	training	Gustav	The intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of glances between ██████ von Aschenbach a composer of some renown and a slim teenage youth Tadzio who see each other from time to time across the tables of the hotel dining room, on the beach and at odd unexpected places around Venice.
pinn0002	training	Mahler	For those who love Venice, this is a film to cherish.<br /><br />██████'s music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama.
pinn0002	training	Armin Mueller-Stahl	good support is offered by a rock solid cast, with a particular highlight being ███████████████████'s stoic Cardinal.
pinn0002	training	Diane	Not real; appears only in █████'s dream sequence.
pinn0002	training	Patrick	And he plays ███████ with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye.
pinn0002	training	Dassin	The characters aren't the most sympathetic and the women are mostly weak, but ██████ still builds an extremely well-crafted suspense film out of them as they pull off a heist that requires the utmost quiet, hide the goods, and then attempt to survive what basically becomes a cross-country cat and mouse game.
pinn0002	training	Jo	Leave it to a gangster film to place most of the emphasis on the missteps on the women, but this time ██'s wife gets the last laugh (if you could call it a laugh) when she predicts "All of you are just going to kill each other."
pinn0002	validation	Jules Dassin	American expatriate ████████████ makes an award-winning French gangster film.
pinn0002	validation	Harry	Here the comedy is not in █████'s big reactions to the danger of sitting perched between two moving cars, but in his slowness to take it in.
pinn0002	validation	Kinski	██████ is, once again, great, although he has only little screen time, and one scene, where he breaks up a fight, is probably the only good scene in this.
pinn0002	validation	Harry Langdon	<br /><br />He's at his best here, and the show is really █████████████'s curious magic and ability to spin comedy out of almost nothing.
pinn0002	validation	David Tennant	".<br /><br />Now only 4 episodes through the latest series (and looking forward to the new Cybermen) I have to say that █████████████'s Doctor is just not as good, of course you may disagree, but I don't think his Doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in theprevious series.
pinn0002	validation	Rose	I mean who'd have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a Dalek prior to this, how many times in this series' history have we had moments like those with ████'s dad, the Emergency Doctor and the 'You were fantastic...so was I' final speech?
pinn0002	validation	Eccleston	I gave it a chance though, and am so glad I did.<br /><br />Yes, some episodes aren't as brilliant as others, but they are all enjoyable, and yes, █████████'s Doctor is far from any we've had before but... █████████'s Doctor is just about the best there is.
pinn0002	validation	Deborah Foreman	You can go to ███████████████'s website to sign a petition to get it released on DVD and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie that are must haves if you like 80's music.
pinn0002	validation	Fred	His friend ████ is pretty funny too.
pinn0002	validation	Nicholas Cage	It is one of █████████████'s first movies and his first starring role.
pinn0002	validation	Julie	█████'s friends don't like him-he doesn't fit in, doesn't go to their school, doesn't have money.
pinn0002	validation	Valley Girl	And I understand that the whole ███████████ talk becomes annoying but that was the 80's.
pinn0002	validation	Shafi Inamdar	It would have been nice that █████████████ would have continued for all the seasons.
pinn0002	validation	Might	█████ as well jack into someone else's imagination, and pretend to be doing something interesting.
pinn0002	validation	Hamlet	██████ OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form.
pinn0002	validation	Claudius	He wants revenge, the throne AND the damnation of ████████' soul in hell.
pinn0002	validation	Shakespeare	If you wish to see ███████████'s masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this BBC version.
pinn0002	validation	Michael Cimino	Also, as ██████████████ took great pains to make the picture historically accurate , it is fascinating as a document of (and maybe indictment of) American life in Old West Wyoming.
pinn0002	validation	Averil	Living a hard life is painful but it can also be invigorating as opposed to the dull life ██████ leads in the epilogue.
pinn0002	validation	Chabert	Colonel ███████ is one of the best adaptations from novel to screen I have seen in the movies.
pinn0002	validation	Hearn	<br /><br />█████'s performance in the San Francisco Opera production convinced me that he has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since I first saw him perform the piece on Broadway and later in the film.	
pinn0002	validation	Sweeney Todd	I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of ████████████ earlier this week.
pinn0002	validation	Miike	And I really liked the yellow-green tint █████ used through the movie, as it impacted very well in outdoor scenes and added just enough grittiness in the indoor scenes.
pinn0002	validation	Richard Chen	Here he presents an overtly dystopian future, however low-key, where a homosexual mayor/dictator (████████████) has the entire village drugged except for a group of rebels.	
pinn0002	validation	Takashi Miike	That none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material but to the pound-for-pound guts that director █████████████ takes with the surroundings and the material.
pinn0002	validation	Lynch	What I found very intriguing with MD, is that █████ constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't.
pinn0002	validation	Diane	There's much symbolism going on here; the box may represent █████'s future (it's empty), or it may be a sort of a Pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open).
pinn0002	validation	Betty	This is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare.<br /><br />Although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to █████, I think they're actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest).
pinn0002	validation	Rogert Ebert	Since, as ████████████ so eloquently puts it "Like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines.
pinn0002	validation	Camilla	He serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks.<br /><br />The hitman: The person that murders ███████.
pinn0002	testing	Eccleston	Not to say this series is not good, just not quite AS good.<br /><br />So whether you like it or not, and whether you prefer Tennant or █████████, The Doctor is back, and he's here to stay.
pinn0002	testing	Valley Girl	I watched ███████████ on HBO one night when my parents were working.
pinn0002	testing	Claudius	He is furious at his mother for marrying ████████ (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified ████████' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself.	
pinn0002	testing	Hearn	To this day, the most moving moment I can ever remember in the theatre occurred when █████ sang "These are my Friends."
pinn0002	testing	Miike	And it all leads up to one last, inexplicable showdown between the two men.<br /><br />Strange that there's yet another film where █████ has peaks and valleys here, sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning to it.
pinn0002	testing	Diane	They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder, and █████'s sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life.<br /><br />A rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman.
pinn0002	testing	Ron Howard	Sadly, that's what this ██████████ film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather.
pinn0002	testing Camilla	We know from the second half that he gets engaged with ███████.
pinn0002	testing	Adam	She's mainly a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film.<br /><br />████: The director.
pinn0002	testing	David Lynch	If you have the DVD of MD, you can "cheat" by looking at ███████████'s "Top 10 Hints to Unlocking MD" (but only upon second or third viewing, please.)
