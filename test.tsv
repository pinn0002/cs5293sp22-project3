The mentor this time is played perfectly by █████████████; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives.
While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments ███████ well.
Well, I have to disagree with ██████████████ on this animated short.
Director ████████████ offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour.
"""It will be the death of ███████████████"""" Fascinating study on changing an image."""
█████ is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film.
Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (█████████████!)
Had to do a double take when I saw that was ███████████ there.
But, overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by █████████.
Of course, none of this would have been possible if █████████████████████ hadn't written his wonderful play.
This film does for Infantry what ████████ did for Submariners.
And ████████████, hyped in the previews, makes a more than bad enough bad guy to Snipes' hero.
"Very nice camera work by ████████████████ and the wonderful ""Albatross"" by Fleetwood Mac at the end."
Even the man you love to hate, her boyfriend Benoit, was wonderful, though you never really like him for the scum that he plays, █████████████████ enacts a perfect cad.
I think ███████████ is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever!
Willem Defoe, ███████████, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all enormous and all very strong.
Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, ██████████████████████ are all here, all enormous and all very strong.
The short film which got ██████████ on the movie map, introducing us to his horrific, but thoroughly interesting character The Butcher, played brilliantly by Phillipe Nahon.
The short film which got Gaspar Noe on the movie map, introducing us to his horrific, but thoroughly interesting character The Butcher, played brilliantly by ██████████████.
"If you enjoy this little chick flick, which received slightly above average reviews by critics and public alike, you might want to check out ████████████'s hit Indie ""Manny & Lo"" (1996)."
As usual, ██████████████ put in another relaxed and realistic performance.
However, for the life of me, I have no idea why ██████████ was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about Westerns.
While nice guy ███████████ (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons.
"████████████, the man who brought ""Hellraiser"", makes a horror movie that is part-Goth, part-Mythology, and all horror in-between."
The ████████████ composed score is as good as it gets, and is among his best work.
The rest of the cast, which includes ████████████ is very good, save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff.
I love this movie, even though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of ████████████████, who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky.
On the outside, this film is better because of █████████████████ (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version.
One of My favorite Stooges shorts with █████ is none other than Brideless Groom!
I prescribe 'Brideless Groom' as medicine for anyone who thinks the Stooges' glory years ended when █████ left.
It tells the story of ████████████, adorably played by P.J.
But like I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with ████████████████.
Neo-realism, by the way, could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather (along with ███████'s The Children Are Watching Us), which that would take shape after the war.
"Tone/Neal/Welles are only a few -and this includes a butchered film called ""The Lady From Shanghai""...""Lady From Shanghai"" took two years to be released, thanks to extensive re-editing -and all because Columbia president ██████████ couldn't understand the story."
Not to mention easily ██████████████'s best performance.
At the same time, Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (██████████████?)
But overall, this game is the best ██████████ experience so far.
With a beautiful setting, wonderful costumes, and an outstanding cast (have I mentioned the gorgeous ██████████████?
Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century.The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 for is █████████████████████████████.
In fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing █████████ running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film.
Look for the first appearance of ███████████ as Young Bull.
Surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention.. ███████████ gives a stellar performance as Daniel Greystone, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go.
Surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention.. Eric Stoltz gives a stellar performance as ████████████████, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go.
The 'meat' of the video is the comments made by ███████████.
I think this testimony from ███████████ shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress.
The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look, especially for ███████████ fans.
Then a reporter, ███████████████, investigates the situation and begins to find answers on why the brides were dying.
Filmed for ████████, Bela Lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respected member of the community.
Filmed for Monogram, ███████████ is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respected member of the community.
"I love the ""haunted house"" bit where █████████ gets stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at Lagosi's sinister mansion."
The aim of the director is obvious--to use an interweaving of speeches/poems as a way to argue against the ████ doctrine.
All ██████'s missing links are still MISSING !
"His comedy raps proved to be a huge influence on latter day gangsta rap, including ███████ who sampled him on his groundbreaking 1992 album ""The Chronic""."""
██████ was obviously working with a low budget here & it shows
Actors that you would never want to see naked get naked (including the Mayor and █████████).
"I had seen ██████████ in Blackadder and the New Statesman, so I thought I'd give this film a try."""
"And ██████████, you can do better, so please, do!"""
Since ██████████████ was originally a comedian, I begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof or a serious action film.
"Three of the things you can say about █████████████ are: he certainly marched to the beat of his own ""drummer;"" he was never at a loss for words; and he obviously felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in every aspect of his life, experiences and thoughts - no matter how trivial at times."
"With this army of kung fu fighting ""hoes"" (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to take back the nightclub from ████████████."
But The XFiles had a good thing going, and ██████ was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic TV characters of the 90s.
██████ died before the movie was completed and it was canned.
█████ does Butch one better by blowing them all to pieces.
fact that █████ overfocuses on two of the most overrated directors and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility.
I'm afraid the 1983 ██████ version just doesn't do anything for me.
You begin to feel █████'s pain and anguish.
█████████████ has done much better things since.
Apparently the film takes some liberties with the true facts, but ████████ believed in the power of the airplane in war and wanted an upgrade in air power for the U.S. as well as the creation of an Air Force.
I've seen other Guinea Pig films, like ███████ in a Manhole He Never Dies, and while they're pretty sick, they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them however dark.
"█████████, who had just made a name for himself in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, stars as a ""nice"" and ""respectable"" mob leader."
I can't wait for the DVD release, as hopefully it will contain comments by ███████████, who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to do this film!
"Who can forget ████████████████ smiling uneasily in his Dali Lhama outfit, overseeing an interpretive dance to the Republican party (""Family"")?"
And my favourite, █████████ embodying the strength of America's education system
As for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune, this criticism falls apart since ███████████, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were dubbed
I wouldn't claim for a second that ████████████ is a masterpiece
I thought this was movie was great, ██████████████ and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie
As ██████████████ remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day
██████████ does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.
The Buddy Holly Story is a great biography with a super performance from ██████████. Busey did his own singing for this film and he does a great job.
So if this will not be a real reviveing for the Italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for █████████████████ after his 'Respiro' another definitive beautiful film
"Compared to ████████████ in the 1976 film ""Carrie,"" Sadako is far nastier, and just like in that earlier film, all heck breaks loose following an instigated public freakout."
"""Ringu 0"" is a fairly slow-moving film, and a surprise revelation concerning ██████ that comes halfway through is very hard to swallow."
Shortly after an oddly quiet young woman, ███████████████ (Yukie Nakama), joins a drama troupe, strange events, including deaths with suspicious circumstances, start occurring.
Is ██████ somehow connected to these events?
The horror stuff generally works, although ██████ would have benefited from not having so many functions.
The script, by █████████████████, from a story by Ring novelist Koji Suzuki, is admirable on an artistic level.
The problem is that director █████████████ just cannot get much momentum going with the material.
"There are glimpses, through ██████ or around her, of a more intriguing world, but they're often little more than ""flashes"" that might cause us to do a double take."
Takahashi and ███████ work hard to establish a romance subplot involving a love triangle (or two), but this can barely get off the ground.
I would have preferred a stronger focus on ████████████ (Yoshiko Tanaka), the reporter who is trying to investigate the psychic demonstration tragedy.
Also ███████ is a very beautiful and cute duck I think.
The direction, music, and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by ███████████████, III.
is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting ███████████ boot camp and how boys are turned into men.
████ Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough, but fair drill instructor in Paris Island North Carolina.
A more recent film, █████████████████, also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing.Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction.
Christina █████, always watchable, is given little in the script to support her nutty character.
█████████ took old action movies from the seventies and copied everything about them.
More than that, I was offended that I was led to believe that I was going to see an actually good movie, which █████████ is not.I couldn't bear to sit through he entire movie.
But what makes 'Eklavya' a tad different is just one name  ████████████████.
The main draw to this one was to see ████████████ (Wonder Woman) out of that curve hugging outfit with her chest free to grace the screen.
